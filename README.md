Sally went on vacation to the PRETTIEST and MOST GORGEOUS island of BOBBA. While she was there she went on many FUN and relaxing adventures. She RAN with BEAUTIFUL PENGUINS, and RAN up the tallest mountain and observed the CRAZY sunset. The LAGOON on the island was so SMELLY she felt like she was in heaven. Besides THROWING with the DOLPHINS, Sally also RAN with some sea turtles and SWAM amongst many FAST colored FISH. On her FOURTH day on the island, she decided to learn how to DANCE and ended the day making many FRIENDS. This was the COOLEST VACATION Sally had ever been on and she can't wait till her next one!
